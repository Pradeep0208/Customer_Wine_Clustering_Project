#  Clustering Analysis on Synthetic, Mall Customer & Wine Quality Datasets

**Author**: Pradeep Anand Mohanasundaram  
**Purpose**: Personal learning project to explore clustering techniques in machine learning  


##  Overview

This project was developed as a personal initiative to master unsupervised machine learning techniques such as **K-Means** and **Hierarchical Clustering**. It applies these algorithms to three datasets:

1. A **synthetic dataset** generated with `make_blobs()`
2. The **Mall Customer dataset**
3. The **Wine Quality dataset**

The objective is to identify natural groupings and patterns in each dataset through effective preprocessing, clustering, and visualization.

## ðŸ“¦ Datasets Used

### 1. Synthetic Dataset
- Created using `make_blobs(n_samples=300, centers=4, cluster_std=0.8)`
- Features: `Feature_1`, `Feature_2`
- Purpose: Demonstrate basic clustering

### 2. Mall Customers Dataset
- Source: Kaggle
- Features: `CustomerID`, `Gender`, `Age`, `Annual Income (k$)`, `Spending Score (1-100)`
- Purpose: Segment customers by income and spending behavior

### 3. Wine Quality Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Features: 11 chemical attributes + `quality`
- Purpose: Identify wine groups with similar chemical characteristics
